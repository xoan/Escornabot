About this repository
---------------------

This repository contains almost all the files for the hardware you need to
build your own *Escornabot*, including models for printed parts and schematics
for a DIY keypad with 5 buttons.

This files are, currently, for an improved version of *Escornabot «Brivoi»*.

Documentation (in spanish) is in the [EscornaWiki][PRO01], the Escornabot
Project Wiki.

Changes in this repository will be eventually pushed to the [main project
repository][REP01] when they are deemed stable enough.
